# DCGAN-Handwritten-Digits
This is a project wherein I designed and implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic handwritten
digits using the MNIST dataset.
I also implemented advanced optimization techniques and checkpoints for efficient model training.
Using this I generated and saved images at each epoch, creating animated GIFs to visually track and evaluate model performance.
